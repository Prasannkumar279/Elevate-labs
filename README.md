Overview:-
This Java program is a simple *console-based calculator* that performs basic arithmetic operations:
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (–)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
The program uses a *loop* to allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit by typing **x** or **X**.

Features:-
 Accepts operators (+, -, *, /)
✔ Reads two integers for the calculation
✔ Handles division safely (avoids divide-by-zero)
✔ Uses a *while loop* for repeated operations
✔ Exits the program when the user enters x or X
✔ Uses the Java Scanner class for user input

##  Code Explanation

### *1. Importing Scanner*

java
import java.util.Scanner;


This allows the program to read user input from the console.

---

### *2. Variable Initialization*

java
int res = 0;


res stores the result of each calculation.

---

### *3. Infinite Loop for Multiple Operations*

java
while (true) {
    ...
}


This loop continues until the user enters 'x' or 'X'.

---

### *4. Reading the Operator*

java
char OP = sc.next().trim().charAt(0);


* Reads a word from the user
* Removes extra spaces
* Extracts the first character
  This allows input like +, *, /, etc.

---

### *5. Checking Valid Operators*

java
if (OP == '+' || OP == '-' || OP == '*' || OP == '/') {


If the operator is valid, the program asks for the two numbers.

---

### *6. Reading Two Numbers*

java
int a = sc.nextInt();
int b = sc.nextInt();


These inputs are used for the selected operation.

---

### *7. Performing the Operation*

Each operation is handled using individual if statements:

java
if (OP == '+') res = a + b;
if (OP == '-') res = a - b;
if (OP == '*') res = a * b;


Division has a special check:

java
if (OP == '/') {
    if (b != 0) {
        res = a / b;
    }
}


---

### *8. Exiting the Program*

java
else if (OP == 'x' || OP == 'X')
    break;


This stops the loop and ends the calculator.

---

### *9. Handling Invalid Operators*

java
else {
    System.out.println("Invalid Operation");
}


---

### *10. Printing the Result*

java
System.out.println(res);


The result is printed after each valid calculation.

---

## ▶ Sample Input/Output

### *Example*


Enter the OP : +
Enter the 1st Number: 10
Enter the 2nd Number: 5
15

Enter the OP : *
Enter the 1st Number: 4
Enter the 2nd Number: 3
12

Enter the OP : x
